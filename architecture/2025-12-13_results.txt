PyQt Node Editor – Audit Results (2025-12-13)

Executive Highlights (Greek summary requested, but file content in English for clarity and codebase sharing)
- Layering is clean: core is Qt-free; graphics/widgets consume theme and tools; interaction tools are wired into the view.
- Serialization/clipboard/history are implemented and stable; JSON structure aligns with docs, but lacks explicit versioning.
- NodeRegistry and built-in nodes are present and consistent with op_code ranges; examples likely depend on internal registry usage.
- Theme engine is present but currently broken: dark theme import path is incorrect and LightTheme is never registered; runtime theme switching is effectively non-functional.
- Graphics assets pull from ThemeEngine but do not refresh on theme change; QSS is applied only at switch time.
- Public API is minimal (Node, Edge, Socket, NodeEditorWidget/Window, NodeRegistry, ThemeEngine), favoring stability but omitting convenience exports (Scene, built-in nodes).
- Interaction tools (drag, reroute, snap, cut-line, intersect) are integrated and operate at the graphics layer.

Evidence Pointers (relative paths)
- Layering & injection: node_editor/core/__init__.py, node_editor/core/node.py, node_editor/graphics/node.py
- Serialization: node_editor/core/scene.py, node_editor/core/node.py, node_editor/core/edge.py, node_editor/core/socket.py
- Theme engine issue: node_editor/themes/theme_engine.py (imports dark.theme, not dark; LightTheme not registered)
- Interaction tools: node_editor/graphics/view.py; node_editor/tools/*.py

Gaps vs Plan
- Theme switching reliability: FAIL (import + registration).
- Theme refresh of live items: PARTIAL (no re-init after switch).
- Versioned serialization: PARTIAL (no version field/migration hooks).
- API surface: PARTIAL (built-in nodes/themes not surfaced for discovery).

Recommended Fixes (succinct)
1) Fix ThemeEngine imports and register LightTheme; gracefully apply QSS if present.
2) Add serialization version field and optional migration hook in Scene.deserialize.
3) Add a lightweight theme-refresh hook (re-init assets on existing graphics items after ThemeEngine.set_theme).
4) Expose helper listings: ThemeEngine.available_themes, NodeRegistry listing convenience; document op_code ranges.
5) Update README/architecture to match actual behavior and add quickstart for themes/serialization/tests.
