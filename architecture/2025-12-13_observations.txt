Observations and Issues (2025-12-13)

1) ThemeEngine defects
   - Imports DarkTheme from non-existent dark.theme module; should import from node_editor.themes.dark.
   - LightTheme is defined but never registered; available_themes() will not include it and set_theme("light") will fail.
   - Graphics items cache theme assets; changing themes does not refresh pens/brushes.

2) Serialization/versioning
   - No explicit version field in serialized Scene/Node/Edge/Socket data; migrations cannot be gated.

3) Runtime theme switching UX
   - QSS applied only via set_theme; existing graphics items never re-init assets, so colors stay stale.

4) API discoverability
   - Public __init__ exports only core and widgets plus NodeRegistry/ThemeEngine; built-in nodes and Scene are not exposed, reducing ease of adoption.

5) Interaction tools configurability
   - Drag/reroute/snap/cut/intersect are always active; no toggles or documented settings for host apps to disable/override behavior.

6) Documentation accuracy
   - Architecture doc and README mention theme switching but do not reflect current LightTheme registration gap or refresh limitations.
